# Maze Algorithms by NeonOrangeOrange

This site is live at (https://NeonOrangeOrange.github.io/maze-algorithm-notes/)[https://NeonOrangeOrange.github.io/maze-algorithm-notes/]

This site is a work in progress. 

The goals of this project are:
- to record my notes about maze generation algorithms.
- to provide iframe-embeddable interactive maze-generation demos.
